# Gaussian-Random-Generator
Implementation of random number generator using 16 LFSRs

A linear feedback shift register (LFSR) is a shift register whose input bit is the output of a linear function of two or more of its previous states. A Gaussian number generator is made by using 16 16-bit LFSR blocks and summing the outputs of these blocks, and in order to confirm the correctness of the generator circuit, a histogram of the generated data is drawn.
